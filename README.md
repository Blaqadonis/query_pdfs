## Introduction
ðŸ…±ðŸ…»ðŸ…°ðŸ†€'s Reader Bot is an innovative web application designed to simplify the process of extracting and querying information from PDF documents. Utilizing OpenAI embeddings, it offers precise, context-aware responses to user queries.

## Features

### 1. **PDF Text Extraction**
   - **Function:** `get_pdf_text`
   - **Description:** Extracts text from uploaded PDF files, handling multiple documents and concatenating their texts for clarity.

### 2. **Text Chunking**
   - **Function:** `handle_user_input`
   - **Description:** Processes raw PDF text into manageable chunks, enabling efficient text handling and analysis.

### 3. **Vector Store Creation**
   - **Part of:** `handle_user_input`
   - **Description:** Converts text chunks into numerical embeddings using OpenAI embeddings for machine learning models.

### 4. **Conversational Retrieval Chain**
   - **Part of:** `handle_user_input`
   - **Description:** Combines vector store with a language model to generate responses to user queries.

### 5. **User Query Handling**
   - **Part of:** `handle_user_input`
   - **Description:** Answers queries related to uploaded PDFs using the conversational chain.
